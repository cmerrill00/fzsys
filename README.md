# fzsys

fzsys is a Bash-based interactive system information menu for Linux, powered by [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).  
It lets you browse and run common system info commands, view live stats, search logs/files/processes, and moreâ€”all from your terminal.

## Features

- System summary (CPU, memory, disk, uptime)
- View CPU, memory, disk, partitions, network, open ports, processes, services, users, logs, hardware info
- Live updating views (watch top processes, disk usage, network)
- Search for processes, logs, or files
- Colorized output for easier reading
- Help and easy exit

## Requirements

- Bash
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- Standard Linux utilities (lscpu, free, df, lsblk, ip, ss, ps, systemctl, who, journalctl, lshw, watch, grep, find)

   sudo cp fzsys.sh /usr/local/bin/fzsys
   ```
3. Ensure [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed:

   fzf --version
   ```
